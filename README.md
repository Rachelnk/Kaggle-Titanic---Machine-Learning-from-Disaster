# Kaggle-Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster 
## Background
- 
## Objectives
- The main objetive of this project is:
  1. Use machine learning to create a model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic Shipwreck.
## Methodology:
The following steps taken:
1. Clean and prepare data for analysis using Pandas.
2. Perform data analysis to uncover insights and feature engineering to create new features to improve ML model performance.
3. Train, test and evaluate the models i.e. LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, GaussianNB, Support Vector Classifier (SVC). Select the model that offers the best prediction.
